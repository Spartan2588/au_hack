✅ FIXES APPLIED:

1. Removed outdated plotly-latest.min.js CDN script from index.html
   - This was causing conflicts with the npm package version
   - Now using only plotly.js-dist-min from package.json

2. Plotly is properly imported in CascadingFailureViz.js:
   - import Plotly from 'plotly.js-dist-min'; (line 5)
   - Used correctly in renderCharts() methods

The 500 error should be resolved. The frontend will now use the npm package version of Plotly instead of the conflicting CDN version.

If you still see errors, refresh the browser (Ctrl+F5 to clear cache).
